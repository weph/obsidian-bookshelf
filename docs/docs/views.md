# Views

Bookshelf adds three views to Obsidian:

## Library

![Library](/img/library.png)

The library view displays all books in your vault.
To learn more about what Bookshelf considers a book, see the [Book Notes section](book-notes.mdx).

To open the library, click the ![library icon](/img/library-big.svg) icon in the ribbon or select "Open
library" from the command palette.

At the top of the library view are several controls:

- **Search field** to search for books using a text query
- **Sort order** to sort books by different criteria and directions
- **Grouping** to group books by:
    - Alphabetically (starting letter)
    - List
    - Author
    - Year (publication year)
    - Rating
- **Reading state filter** (Learn more about reading state on
  the [Reading Progress page](reading-progress.md#reading-state))
    - All books
    - Unread
    - Reading
    - Abandoned
    - Finished

You can also toggle between gallery and table view.

Clicking on a book opens the [Book Details Modal](views.md#book-details-modal). To open the book's note directly
instead, hold a modifier key while clicking (CMD on macOS, CTRL on Windows and Linux).

## Statistics

![Statistics](/img/statistics.png)

The statistics view provides various metrics about the books you've read.
To learn more about how you can track your reading progress using Bookshelf, take a look at
the [Reading Progress section](reading-progress.md)

To open the statistics, click the ![statistics icon](/img/chart-spline.svg) icon in the ribbon, or select
"Open statistics" from the command palette.

You can switch between viewing statistics for all time or for a specific year using the dropdown at the top of the view.

## Book Details Modal

![Book Details Modal](/img/book-details.png)

The book details modal shows detailed information for a selected book and allows you to update the reading progress.

To open the book modal, click on any book in the library or statistics view. You can also use the "Open book modal"
command if the currently open note is a book note.
