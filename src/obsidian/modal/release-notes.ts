### Added

- **Release notes dialog**\\
  After each update, a dialog will now appear showing you what's new, improved, or fixed. Donâ€™t want the interruption? You can turn it off in the settings.
- **Open book note directly from gallery/table view** ([#8](https://github.com/weph/obsidian-bookshelf/issues/8))\\
  You can now open a book's note directly by holding a modifier key while clicking a book in the gallery or table view (CMD on macOS, CTRL on Windows and Linux). Thanks to [@soundslikeinfo](https://github.com/soundslikeinfo) for the suggestion!
- **Allow filtering books in the library by list** ([#7](https://github.com/weph/obsidian-bookshelf/issues/7))\\
  The list filter will only appear if you're using lists.
- **Show number of books in library** ([#12](https://github.com/weph/obsidian-bookshelf/issues/12))\\
  The total number of books is now displayed at the top of the library. When searching or applying filters, you'll see both the number of matching books and the total. If books are grouped, the count for each group will also be shown.
- **Support Daily Notes via Periodic Notes plugin** ([#18](https://github.com/weph/obsidian-bookshelf/issues/18))\\
  Bookshelf now also supports Daily Notes via the Periodic Notes plugin.

### Fixed

- The library view now correctly displays a "no results" message when no books match the active filters or search query
